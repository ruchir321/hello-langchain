note:

1. Some  notes are repetitive from other notebooks & readme files, just for ease of reference.
2. This course is ancient (in AI hypetrain years). E.g.: `LLMChains` are now deprecated and replaced by `LCEL` and `LangGraph` (see changes.ipynb)

I'm using locally available ollama model `llama3.2`

## prompt templates

### big idea

use a skeleton of a prompt and fill in specific details programatically (instead of retyping the prompt in the code each time)

## find out later

`ChatPromptTemplate` vs `PromptTemplate`
